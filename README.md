## Why this Project? üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

A lot of things go in organizing a successful event and being a community person, i know that.

To handle the problem of the people who are not that good at organizing an event, i have created Eventizer which will help them get their event up and running with a few click along with providing them with a better reach for their events.

This app is the **event creator** section for Eventizer and through this app/section the communities or folks from the communities can create their event and see the mails of the people who have registered for their events. 

Every time a user is registering, he will be be getting a mail for the same with all the details related to the event.

Sometimes, there are unfortunate conditions due to which an event needs to be updated or cancelled. The also allows you to do that. 

Every participant will get a mail when you update or cancel you event which keeps the attendees updated as well with the event schedule.
